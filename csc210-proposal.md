CSC 210 Project Proposal

UR Cross-Facility Fabrication Ability Communicator - (UR XFAC)

* Moses Chen - mchen37@u.rochester.edu
* Yaron Adar - yadar@u.rochester.edu

When a student comes by one of the multiple student fabrication facilities at the UofR, the employee in charge will grant  permission based on previous training or, given insufficient training, train the student. Currently, if a student claims they gained training at a different facility, the employee has no way to immediately verify that the student is trained and refreshed on specific equipment. An uncomfortable gray area is navigated between trust and potentially wasted time.

The natural solution is enabling immediate communication between facilities about 1) what shop tools and shop processes a student has received formal training on and 2) how long ago the student received the formal training. The spontaneous nature of the visits our proposal addresses would be best-served by a network-accessible database of student certifications which is fast in look-up and secure in logging. The data it would store is not sensitive.
